Release: v1.0-openwrt
Working:
 - OpenWrt boots
 - PHY ethernet port
 - USB ethernet port
 - LEDs
## Note
This port is not yet ready for upstream-openwrt. A lot of work is to be done to kernel device tree source as well as u-boot and a whole lot of cleanup before sending it to openwrt PR. I will continue to contribute code here until it is ready for PR at openwrt master.
